CIDER started its life as an effort to replace a hacked version of SLIME with
a proper environment for Clojure development on Emacs. The work on it was
fueled mostly by the advent of nREPL which was the first project that aimed to
provide a common tool-agnostic foundation for Clojure development tools.

The project was started in 2012 by Phil Hagelberg (of Leiningen fame),
who hacked a prototype of an nREPL client in Emacs Lisp on a flight to
San Francisco.  He got a bit stuck on the socket-based bencode
functionality and dropped it after the flight, but not before pushing
the code out and mentioning it on the http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2bd91de7dca55ca4[Clojure mailing list].footnote:[https://technomancy.us/163]

Fortunately Tim King picked it back up, and it quickly became a respectable competitor to SLIME.
The project evolved at rapid pace and eventually superseded SLIME in August 2012. Unfortunately in early 2013
Tim ran out of time for `nrepl.el` and after a period of stagnation, eventually handed it over to Bozhidar, who has been the steward
ever since. Bozhidar renamed `nrepl.el` to CIDER in version 0.3 to avoid the common case of confusion between
the nREPL server and the nrepl package for Emacs.footnote:[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/375]

Eventually CIDER became one of the most popular development environments in the Clojure community and it spawned many
important projects like `cider-nrepl`, `cljs-tooling` and `orchard`, that were widely used by other development tools.
Over the years a big ecosystem of packages grew around CIDER and nREPL. Today CIDER faces a lot of competition, but
it's still evolving at a steady pace and it's still one of the more innovative Clojure development environments,
that serves as inspiration for many others.
