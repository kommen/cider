# Indentation

## Dynamic Indentation

It is common for macros to require special indentation mechanisms. This is most
common in macros that start with `do`, `def`, or `with-`.  CIDER has some
heuristics to detect these macros, but it also lets you explicitly specify how
a macro should be indented.

Here's a simple example of how someone would specify the indent spec for a macro
they've written (using an example in core):

```clojure
(defmacro with-in-str
  "[DOCSTRING]"
  {:style/indent 1}
  [s & body]
  ...cut for brevity...)
```

And here's a more complex one:

```clojure
(defmacro letfn
  "[DOCSTRING]"
  {:style/indent [1 [[:defn]] :form]}
  [fnspecs & body]
  ...cut for brevity...)
```

Don't worry if this looks intimidating. For most macros the indent spec should
be either just a number, or one of the keywords `:defn` or `:form`. A full
description of the spec is provided in the
[indent spec section of the manual](indent_spec.md).

If you *don't* want to use this feature, you can disable it by setting
`cider-dynamic-indentation` to `nil` in your Emacs init file.

```el
(setq cider-dynamic-indentation nil)
```
